The Twelfth International Workshop on Rocq for Programming Languages: [RocqPL](https://popl25.sigplan.org/home/CoqPL-2025)

The goal of this workshop is to provide an opportunity for programming languages researchers and practitioners with an interest in the Rocq Prover to meet and interact with one another and with members of the core Rocq development team. At the meeting, we will discuss upcoming new features, see talks and demonstrations of active projects, solicit feedback for potential future work on Rocq itself, and generally work to strengthen the vibrant community around our favorite proof assistant.

Topics in scope include:

- Formalizations of programming language research in Rocq
- General purpose libraries and tactic language extensions
- Domain-specific libraries for programming language formalization and verification
- IDEs, profilers, tracers, debuggers, and testing tools
- Reports on ongoing proof efforts conducted via (or in the context of) the Rocq Prover
- Experience reports from Rocq usage in educational or industrial contexts

To foster open discussion of cutting edge research which can later be published in full conference proceedings, we will not publish papers from the workshop.
